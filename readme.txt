A pop-up window that invites visitors to follow you on Spontit.


== Description ==

This plugin creates a pop-up window that asks if the website visitor wants to follow a Spontit channel. The invitation link to the channel can be added in settings, and the pop-up will only display if it's a valid Spontit link.
